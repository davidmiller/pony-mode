* Housekeeping
** TODO Make dir-excursion a macro.
** TODO Take a long hard look at all the directory traversal stuff.
   Do it once, and do it well.

* Bugs
** DONE Database settings fails to take account of Django 1.2+ Format
** DONE Pony-fabric fails unpleasantly with projects that have no Fabfile
** DONE Pony-list-commands seems broken in emacs -q -- requires further investigation
** DONE Pony-dumpdata requires port to the new API
** DONE Pony-temp-server Possibly never worked - surely a typo?
** DONE Pony-browser shouldn't be a blocking wait.
** DONE Syncdb needs new calling conventions
** DONE Command if exists as a wrapper
* Roadmap
** DONE 0.2 Release
*** DONE Blockers
    1) All known bugs
    2) Virtualenv Support
*** DONE Other
       1) yasnppet to defcustom
** IN PROGRESS 0.3 Release...
*** Required Features
**** Use syntax table for Tpl-mode comment highlighting
**** Use Dir locals instead of ponyrc
     Provide interactive M-x make-project and edit project to
     edit the pony-project struct.

     We should keep support for .ponnyrc until a 1.0 release, emitting
     a message that suggests moving to dir-locals.el and not documenting the functionality.

*** Desired Features
   1) Jump to view at point in Browser
   2) Consolidate all the Management commands into a single macro interface (pony-defmanage "flush")
   3) Run multiple dev servers from one Emacs instance
   4) Test-case-mode backend
   5) Build system
   6) Interactive database decisions for multiple configured dbs
   7) Tab indentation for django template tags.
