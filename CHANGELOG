Project structure
-----------------

The project now has a new directory structure, which places the Elisp files that make up Pony Mode in ./src

Alternative settings files
--------------------------

Pony-mode now supports setting an alternative settings file to use, either globally or on a per project basis through the pony-project call in .dir-locals.el

Restarting The Development Server
---------------------------------

Previously, running  pony-runserver when the server was running wouldmessage "already running".

Now, this will take you to the server buffer.

From the server buffer, running pony-runserver will restart the server.

Pony Test
---------

Now clears the test buffer on each invocation.

Virtualenv Support
------------------

Pony-mode now has `native' support for Virtualenv...
This means that when launching commands or sub-processes, pony-mode will attempt to determine whether your project is in a Virtualenv, and if so, will use the appropriate interpreter/site-packages.

This assumes a project structure along these lines (Where envious is the Virtualenv root):

davidmiller@Dev-pc-14:~/programming/python$ tree -L 2 envious/

If your directories are structured differently and things don't work, file bugs!

New defcustom `pony-sqlite-program'
-----------------------------------

This variable is the name of the program used by `pony-db-shell' when your project's database is SQLite3. Defaults to "sqlite3".
Either:
    M-x customize-group pony
    (setq pony-db-shell "foobar")

Miscelaneous
-----------

* M-x pony-fabric will fail elegantly if there is no fabfile for the project
* M-x pony-temp-server bug fixed for lightweight alternative server host:port instances
* Numerous functions ported to the new calling API
* M-x pony-browser now uses callbacks rather than blocking waits for the server to initialize
* Better failure for pony-get-setting where the setting does not exist
